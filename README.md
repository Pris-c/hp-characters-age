# Harry Potter characters's current age

## Sobre

To practice the backend development I chose to use an [API](https://hp-api.onrender.com/) about one of my favorites histories, witch is Harry Potter's one.
It's a simple project that returns the current age of some of the characters.

Currently, the [HP-API](https://hp-api.onrender.com/) has informations of 402 characters. In this project it was used the follwoing attributes:

Key	| Type	| Description
----|-------|------------
name |	string	| The name of the character.

yearOfBirth |	# Harry Potter characters's current age
